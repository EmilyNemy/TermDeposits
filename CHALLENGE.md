Take Home Code Challenge
Hello and thanks so much for taking the time to do the Ferocia Code Challenge.
Why are we asking you to do this?
We want to talk to you about code - how you write it, how you think about it, how you
turn ideas into concrete programs, what makes good code. We want to do this in a way
that gives you the chance to show your skills at their finest, in a context that we both
understand. This code challenge is designed to give us common context that we are
both “experts” in so that we can have that talk.
What are we asking you to do?
We are a company that creates banking software. We’d like you to build a very simple
term deposit calculator that takes as inputs:
Start deposit amount (e.g. $10,000)
Interest rate (e.g. 1.10%)
Investment term (e.g. 3 years)
Interest paid (Monthly, Quarterly, Annually, At Maturity)
And produces as output:
Final balance (e.g. $10,330 on the above inputs, interest paid At Maturity)
You can check your outputs using this calculator*. You can assume that all proceeds are
reinvested into the term deposit for its duration.
Non-functional requirements
CLI is fine, although of course if you want to make a simple UI because you think
that best demonstrates your skills, please do. We won’t give points to a beautiful UI
so ask you to please spend your time on the code and not CSS if you do decide to
create a UI.

Take Home Code Challenge 2
We strongly recommend you don’t spend more than 2 hours on this as we just want
a conversation starter and not a fully pro application. Refer to the guide below for
what we are looking for, and as long as you can speak to each of these points you
should consider yourself done. Please don’t include setup (of
computer/environment) time in the 2 hours, you know how that can blow out.
Any language is fine, and we recommend you choose your strongest language.
Please submit using a link to a Github repository. If this could cause issues for you
we will accept a .zip file with your code, just get in touch if this is the case.
What are we looking for?
Simplicity - can we understand your code and how you’ve structured it?
Maintainability - could we change requirements and easily extend the application,
and would we know if we broke existing functionality?
Feedback - how have you handled errors and let the user know?
Usability - can we work out how to install and run it?
Style - how proficient are you at the technologies you’ve chosen?

*HINT: There are all kinds of compound interest equations out there. The ones that take
year and month as arguments tend to be a lot more confusing than those that just take
a single time input (e.g. month OR year, not both).
